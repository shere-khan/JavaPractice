 * TASKS:
 * NOTE: Don't worry about access modifiers when creating your methods. Focus on return types and parameters only.
 * (1) Create a method called 'add'. It should take 2 integers as parameters and return the value of them added together.
 * (2) Create a method called 'subtract'. It should take 2 integers as parameters and return the value of the first parameter minus the second.
 * (3) Create a method called 'multiply'. It should take 2 integers as parameters and return the value of the multiplied together.
 * (4) Create a method called 'divide'. It should take 2 integers as parameters and return the value of the first parameter divided by the second.
 * (5) Create a method called 'testCalc'. It should return an integer equal to (10 + 10) / (20 - (3 * 5)) using ONLY the methods you've created.
